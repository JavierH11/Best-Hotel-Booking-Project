### About the Project:
Create a software that allows the user to pick from different room types. In the homepage, the user will be given the option to modify a reservation or create a new one.The user should be able to `reserve` from an available set of dates the check in and check out dates. From the chosen dates, different `room types` will be displayed that will account for the amount of people, number of bets, and certain amenities. These amenities can include a kitchenette or bathtub, or others. Once the user confirms their choices, they can see the total price of their stay with a `summary of their choices`. 

If the user confirms the summary, user information will be requested. The user will be prompted for their payment information, name, and other contact items. A unique confirmation number will be generated once the user agrees to pay and give the choice to be brought back to the homepage. The confirmation alongside a summary of the booking will be emailed to the user. The user should be able to go back to the homepage and choose the “modify reservation” option to make `changes/cancel` their booking. The homepage will have a button that reads `“Generate Management Report”`. If a user were to click on it, it would prompt for a password. If the password is correct, a summary of all the bookings that have been made will be displayed. This summary will include total revenue, total bookings, total available rooms, and room cancellations.

### Software tools, languages, databases for the project:

- Code for the frontend and backend will be Python.
- Version control through GIT.
- Tkinter platform to write software applications.
- Due to lack of experience with databases amongst the group, we have decided to not use any databases for the project. 
- The software will create a text file and be stored directly into the user’s desktop.
